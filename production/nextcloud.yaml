    syncOptions:     # Sync options which modifies sync behavior
    - CreateNamespace=true # Namespace Auto-Creation ensures that namespace specified as the application destination exists in the destination cluster.

    - PruneLast=true # Allow the ability for resource pruning to happen as a final, implicit wave of a sync operation

        duration: 5s # the amount to back off. Default unit is seconds, but could also be a duration (e.g. "2m", "1h")
        factor: 2 # a factor to multiply the base duration after each failed retry
        maxDuration: 3m # the maximum amount of time allowed for the backoff strategy
